# Bioinformatics: Gene-Disease Research in the Post-Genomic Era
This was a project for my Foundations of Data Science course at Northeastern University. We were given a database of gene-disease associations from DisGeNET, identifying what genes are implicated in various human diseases. We were also provided with a table from GO that describes the known functions of these genes. In addition, we were given some background reading to familiarize ourselves with the data.

We had to build a database containing the DisGeNET and GO data, explore it, and answer provided research questions as well as come up with one of our own.
